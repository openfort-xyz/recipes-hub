## How to run locally

**1. Clone and configure the sample**

```
git clone https://github.com/openfort-xyz/samples
cd firebase-wagmi-nextjs
```

Copy the .env.local.example file into a file named .env.local in the folder of the server you want to use. For example:

```
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

You will need an Openfort account in order to run the demo. Once you set up your account, go to the Openfort [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.openfort.xyz/apikeys) to find your API keys.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENFORT_PUBLIC_KEY=<replace-with-your-publishable-key>
NEXTAUTH_OPENFORT_SECRET_KEY=<replace-with-your-secret-key>
```

**2. Create a Policy and add a Contract**

[![Required](https://img.shields.io/badge/REQUIRED-TRUE-ORANGE.svg)](https://shields.io/)

You can create Policies and add Contracts in the Dashboard or with the API. This sample requires a Policy and a Contract to run. Once you've created them, and add its ID tor `.env`.

`NEXTAUTH_OPENFORT_PLAYER` is the ID of a [Player](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/api/players#create-a-player) for your player. 

`NEXTAUTH_OPENFORT_CONTRACT` is the ID of a [Contract](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/reference/api/create-contract-object) for your contract. A contract has a chainId. 
If you need a test contract address, use 0x38090d1636069c0ff1Af6bc1737Fb996B7f63AC0 (NFT contract deployed in 80001 Mumbai).

`NEXTAUTH_OPENFORT_POLICY` is the ID of a [Policy](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/reference/api/create-a-policy-object) for your contract. A policy has a contract and chainId. For this demo to work, the policy must have both the contract and the register sessions as rules.

**3. Get your Firebase Config**

First go to Firebase config: Console > Project settings > General adn create an app for your prohject if you still don't have one.
