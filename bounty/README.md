# OpenFort Bounty Playbook

The primary motivation behind the OpenFort Bounty Program is to establish a sustainable model for web3 builders who wish to utilize real infrastructure and receive compensation for teaching others. 

# Overview

The OpenFort Bounty Program is a structured framework designed to support builders and technical creators in producing real implementations and educational content using OpenFort infrastructure. 

The Openfort Bounty Program is funded solely by resources allocated by the Openfort team. It is non-profit in nature and relies only on publicly available tools. Its primary purpose is to reward builders and creators who build with Openfort infrastructure and educate the web3 ecosystem, while using clearly defined time windows to make delivery timelines and target completion predictable.

# Budget

The budget of the first round of the Bounty Program is five thousand dollars and 00 cents(USD 5,000), which is estimated to run for the first quarter of 2026. 

The reward for completion is based on 3 categories of bounty complexity: 

- **Easy:** The reward for completion of the Bounty Issue of complexity level `Easy` is a hundred dollars and 00 cents(USD 100)
- **Medium:** The reward for completion of the Bounty issue of complexity level `Medium` is three hundred and fifty dollars(USD 250)
- **Hard:** The reward for completion of the Bounty issue of complexity level `Hard` is four hundred dollars(USD 400)

The approximate maximum quantity of Bounty issues per quarter varies from eighteen to twenty-two(18-22).

# Claiming a Bounty

To avoid duplicated effort and ghost work, all bounties must be explicitly claimed. Claiming a bounty simply means the OpenFort team has designated a specific bounty issue to a participant. 

### How to Claim a Bounty

To claim a bounty in the Openfort Bounty Program, follow these steps:

1. **Browse the bounty dashboard** and choose an issue you’d like to work on.
2. **Submit a short claim proposal** (200 words or fewer) in the bounty thread, explaining who you are and why you’re a good fit for this bounty.
3. **Wait for review** by the Openfort bounty team.
4. **If approved**, the bounty automation will assign the issue to you and mark it as claimed.

### Activity Window

Once a bounty is assigned, its activity window begins. The length of this window depends on the **complexity level** of the bounty issue.

The activity windows are defined as follows:

- **Easy:** Bounties tagged as `Easy` have an activity window of **2–4 days** from the assignment date.
- **Medium:** Bounties tagged as `Medium` have an activity window of **7–12 days** from the assignment date.
- **Hard:** Bounties tagged as `Hard` have an activity window of **10–15 days** from the assignment date.

Participants are expected to show meaningful progress within the assigned activity window. Failure to do so may result in the bounty being reopened.

> Note: Bounty participants must show visible progress within the bounty window.
> 

### Reopening Bounties

We recognize that multiple participants may be interested in the same bounty. To keep the program fair and moving, bounties are reopened if no meaningful progress updates are provided within the assigned activity window.

Once reopened, a bounty becomes available to other contributors without exception.

## Submission & Review Process

All Openfort bounty submissions must be made via a **GitHub pull request** with the associated bounty issue clearly tagged. This ensures transparent tracking of submissions while maintaining long-term maintainability.

### How to Submit

To submit a valid bounty contribution, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Openfort bounty project** on GitHub.
2. Open a pull request and include `bounty:` in the PR title.
3. In the PR description, provide:
    - A link to the final output (GitHub repository, video, or written content)
    - Links to relevant Openfort documentation used
    - A brief explanation of what was built or demonstrated
4. Submit the pull request and wait for review.

### Review Expectations

- All submissions are reviewed by the Openfort team
- Reviews may include requests for clarification or minor changes
- Submitting a PR does **not** guarantee acceptance or payment

### Review Window

- Contributors should expect an initial review within **4–5 days**
- Silence during the review window does not imply rejection

# Acceptance & Payment

All bounty submissions are reviewed and accepted at the sole discretion of the **OpenFort team**. Before a submission can be accepted, **all defined bounty requirements must be fully met**.

Once a submission is approved, the final decision is documented and clearly communicated to the contributor. Only after acceptance can the bounty reward be claimed.

All payments are issued in **stablecoins**. Participants must be able to receive cryptocurrency payments to be eligible for compensation.

### Important Canon

- Partial or incomplete work is **not eligible for payment**, unless explicitly stated in the bounty description
- If multiple valid submissions are received for the same bounty, **only one submission will be rewarded**
- OpenFort’s decisions are final; however, **rationale will be shared** to maintain transparency and fairness

# Evaluation Criteria

Bounty submissions are evaluated only after all stated bounty requirements have been fully met. Acceptance and payment are processed based on OpenFort’s evaluation standards.

Because OpenFort bounties span multiple contribution types, submissions are evaluated according to their **assigned category**. Each category follows its own evaluation criteria to ensure fair and relevant assessment.

For a detailed breakdown of how each category is evaluated, refer to the evaluation document to [learn more](./EVALUATION.md).


# Bounty Sustainability

The OpenFort Bounty Program is designed to support builders and technical creators who want hands-on experience with real wallet infrastructure, while being fairly compensated for educating others.

To ensure long-term sustainability:

- Each bounty round operates within a **clearly defined budget**
- OpenFort reserves the right to **pause, adjust, or discontinue** the program at any time
- Bounty terms may evolve between rounds, but **changes will never apply retroactively**

> This Playbook is not about control. It exists to reduce emotional labour for the OpenFort team, turn subjective decisions into consistent, process-driven outcomes, and allow OpenFort team to say “This isn’t personal — this is the process.” 

The Consistency is what keeps program healthy.
> 

### Future Opportunities

Exceptional bounty contributions may open the door to deeper collaboration. Contributors whose work consistently demonstrates quality, clarity, and impact may be considered for:

1. **Ongoing paid engagements** beyond the bounty program, including higher-scope or longer-term collaborations.
2. Recognition as a **`Community Creator`**, with opportunities to participate in hackathons, workshops, early access programs, and product beta testing. 

# Usage Right
