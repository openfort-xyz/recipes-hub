# Web3Auth with Openfort

This sample uses Web3Auth as the key management and authentication solution.

It uses Server-Side Verification (SSV) via Social login to authenticate a player. It will create a self-custodial account for the player and collect an asset with it.

It is lightly based off of [a sample from Web3Auth](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/tree/main/web-no-modal-sdk/server-side-verification/ssv-via-social-nextjs-no-modal-example).


## Demo

- [Live demo](https://sample-web3auth-nextjs.vercel.app)

This demo authenticates a player using NextAuth. It will create smart contract account where the private key is managed through Web3Auth through their authentication. The smart account is deployed as soon as an on  chain action is performed (either registering a session key or minting an NFT).


## Features

- üç® Next.JS as ‚öõÔ∏è React client framework with NextAuth for authentication.
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Web3Auth as the key management and authentication solution.
- üè∞ Openfort Session Keys.

## How to run locally

**1. Clone and configure the sample**

```
git clone https://github.com/openfort-xyz/samples
cd web3auth-nextjs
```

Copy the .env.local.example file into a file named .env.local in the folder of the server you want to use. For example:

```
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

You will need an Openfort account in order to run the demo. Once you set up your account, go to the Openfort [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.openfort.xyz/apikeys) to find your API keys.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENFORT_PUBLIC_KEY=<replace-with-your-publishable-key>
NEXTAUTH_OPENFORT_SECRET_KEY=<replace-with-your-secret-key>
```

The other environment variables are configurable:

`NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ID` is the client_id from Google. You can get it from https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

`NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3_AUTH_ID` is the client_id from Web3Auth. You can get it from https://dashboard.web3auth.io


You can follow the instructions on how to set up the Web3Auth sample in the [Web3Auth Google documentation](https://web3auth.io/docs/content-hub/guides/google).

**2. Create a Policy and Contract**

[![Required](https://img.shields.io/badge/REQUIRED-TRUE-ORANGE.svg)](https://shields.io/)

You can create Policies and add Contracts in the Dashboard or with the API. This sample requires a Policy and a Contract to run. Once you've created them, and add its ID to your `.env`.


`NEXTAUTH_OPENFORT_CONTRACT` is the ID of a [Contract](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/api/contracts#create-a-contract) for your contract. A contract has a chainId. 
If you need a test contract address, use 0x38090d1636069c0ff1Af6bc1737Fb996B7f63AC0 (NFT contract deployed in 80001 Mumbai).

`NEXTAUTH_OPENFORT_POLICY` is the ID of a [Policy](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/api/policies#create-a-policy) for your contract. A policy has a contract and chainId. For this demo to work, the policy must have both the contract and the register sessions as rules.


**3. Follow the server instructions on how to run**
