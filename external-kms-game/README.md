`OPENFORT_CONTRACT` is the ID of a [Contract](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/api/contracts#create-a-contract) for your contract. A contract has a chain_id. 
If you need a test contract address, use 0x38090d1636069c0ff1Af6bc1737Fb996B7f63AC0 (NFT contract deployed in 80001 Mumbai).

`OPENFORT_POLICY` is the ID of a [Policy](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/api/policies#create-a-policy) for your contract. A policy has a contract and chain_id. For this demo to work, the policy must have both the contract and the register sessions as rules.
