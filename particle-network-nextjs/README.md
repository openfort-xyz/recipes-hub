# Particle Network with Openfort

This sample uses Particle Network as the key management and authentication solution.

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Particle Network as the key management and authentication solution.

```

You will need an Openfort account in order to run the demo. Once you set up your account, go to the Openfort [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.openfort.xyz/apikeys) to find your API keys.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENFORT_PUBLIC_KEY=<replace-with-your-publishable-key>

The other environment variables are configurable:

`NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID`,`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY`,`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID` is the client_id from Particle. You can get it from https://dashboard.particle.network/

**2. Create a Policy and Contract**

[![Required](https://img.shields.io/badge/REQUIRED-TRUE-ORANGE.svg)](https://shields.io/)

You can create Policies and add Contracts in the Dashboard or with the API. This sample requires a Policy and a Contract to run. Once you've created them, and add its ID to your `.env`.

`NEXTAUTH_OPENFORT_CONTRACT` is the ID of a [Contract](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/reference/api/create-contract-object) for your contract. A contract has a chainId. 
If you need a test contract address, use 0x38090d1636069c0ff1Af6bc1737Fb996B7f63AC0 (NFT contract deployed in 80001 Mumbai).

`NEXTAUTH_OPENFORT_POLICY` is the ID of a [Policy](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/reference/api/create-a-policy-object) for your contract. A policy has a contract and chainId. For this demo to work, the policy must have both the contract and the register sessions as rules.
