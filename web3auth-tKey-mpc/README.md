You can create Policies and add Contracts in the Dashboard or with the API. This sample requires a Policy and a Contract to run. Once you've created them, and add its ID to your `.env`.

`REACT_APP_OPENFORT_CONTRACT` is the ID of a [Contract](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/api/contracts#create-a-contract) for your contract. A contract has a chainId. 
If you need a test contract address, use 0x38090d1636069c0ff1Af6bc1737Fb996B7f63AC0 (NFT contract deployed in 80001 Mumbai).

`REACT_APP_OPENFORT_POLICY` is the ID of a [Policy](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/api/policies#create-a-policy) for your contract. A policy has a contract and chainId. For this demo to work, the policy must have both the contract and the register sessions as rules.

`REACT_APP_OPENFORT_PLAYER` is the ID of youre [Player](https://www.openfort.xyz/docs/api/policies#create-a-player).
